description: "Intent-Based Regeneration, Refine Mode, and Subscriber Boost put you in the driver's seat of every conversation."
---

No more random swipes. No more slot machines.  
Every regen now listens to you, and every word you write can be expanded into something beautiful. ✨

## 1) 🎯 Intent-Based Regeneration

<Check>
  Every regen obeys you—steer tone, length, plot, and style with a single command.
</Check>

Say goodbye to mashing the regenerate button 10+ times hoping for something different. Now you can tell the AI *exactly* how to rewrite the response.

<div align="center">
  <img 
    src="/images/changelog/2025_11_03/regen-ui.png" 
    alt="Intent-Based Regeneration Interface" 
    style={{
      borderRadius: "12px",
      boxShadow: "0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)",
      border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)",
      margin: "2rem 0",
    }}
  />
</div>

### How It Works

1. Click the **Regeneration** icon on any AI response
2. Type or select your intent (free-form or from presets)
3. Get a rewritten response that follows your exact direction

### Intent Examples

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tone Control" icon="palette">
    "Make it darker" · "More romantic" · "Add tension" · "Lighter and funnier"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Length Adjustments" icon="ruler">
    "Triple the length" · "Short and punchy" · "Add more detail"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plot Steering" icon="map">
    "Branch to a new plot: she refuses the deal" · "Advance the story with a twist"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Style & POV" icon="pen">
    "First-person inner monologue" · "Show more sensory details" · "Increase dialogue"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Pro Tip**: Combine multiple intents like "longer, more romantic, with inner thoughts" for precise control over the narrative direction.

## 2) ✨ Refine Mode: Transform Your Input

<Check>
  Type simple stubs—AI expands them into rich, in-persona dialogue that matches your character perfectly.
</Check>

Ever know *what* you want to say but not *how* to phrase it in character? Refine Mode turns your rough ideas into polished, vivid responses.

<div align="center">
  <img 
    src="/images/changelog/2025_11_03/refine-before-after.png" 
    alt="Refine Mode Before and After Comparison" 
    style={{
      borderRadius: "12px",
      boxShadow: "0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)",
      border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)",
      margin: "2rem 0",
    }}
  />
</div>

### Real Example

**Before (your input):**  
```
i took pity on her
```

**After (Refined):**  
```
*Sits down quietly, trying not to intrude on her space, 
a faint look of sadness on my face* 
"It's all okay. I'm just sad for you."
```

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Character Voice" icon="microphone">
    Automatically matches your character's tone, quirks, and personality
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scene Aware" icon="eye">
    Takes context from the conversation to write grounded, natural responses
  </Card>
  <Card title="Speed to Quality" icon="bolt">
    Skip the struggle of crafting the perfect line—get it instantly
  </Card>
  <Card title="Preview First" icon="glasses">
    Review the refined version before sending to ensure it's exactly what you want
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  Perfect for when you're in a creative flow but want the AI to handle the descriptive heavy lifting.

## 3) 🚀 Subscriber Boost: Auto Best Model

<Check>
  Automatic smart routing to the highest-tier model for your plan—better outputs, zero setup.
</Check>

No toggles. No configuration. Just better quality automatically.

### How It Works

When you use **Regeneration** or **Auto**, the system automatically selects the best available model based on your subscription tier:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Free Users" icon="star">
    Optimized routing within available models
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prime" icon="crown">
    Auto-routes to **Titan** for premium quality
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prime+" icon="gem">
    Access to the absolute best models available
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example:**  
Your preset = Titan · Your plan = Prime → uses **Titan** 🚀  
No extra cost. No extra clicks. Just better responses.

<Info>
  Subscriber Boost works seamlessly with both Intent-Based Regeneration and Refine Mode, ensuring you always get the highest quality output your plan allows.
</Info>

## 4) 🎨 Why This Matters

### The Problem We Solved

Before this update, users faced three major frustrations:

- **Random Regeneration**: Hit "regen" 10+ times hoping for something different
- **Weak Input Expression**: Know what you want to say but can't phrase it well in character
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Not getting the best possible output from your subscription

### The Solution

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Surgical Control" icon="crosshairs">
    Direct every regen with specific intent instead of random retries
  </Card>
  <Card title="Input Enhancement" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Turn rough ideas into polished, in-persona prose
  </Card>
  <Card title="Guaranteed Quality" icon="shield-check">
    Always get the best model your plan allows, automatically
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fewer Retries" icon="gauge-high">
    One guided regen often beats 3 random ones—save time, maintain flow
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
