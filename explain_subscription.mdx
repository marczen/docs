## The math speaks:
250 Titan chats alone would cost $15 if bought per coin.  

- 1,000 Titan chats → **$60**
- 1,000 bonus coins → **$15**

**Total value** is \$75 and **you only pay** \$14.99!

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens to my existing coins if I subscribe?">
    They are safe! Your purchased `General Coins` and free daily coins remain in your wallet with no expiration date. Our system will always use your expiring `Subscription Coins` first before touching your `General Coins`, so you get the maximum value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I still use models that aren't 'unlimited' in my plan?">
    Absolutely. For example, if you're a Prime member and want to try the Sage model or generate an image, you can do so using your monthly Subscription Coins or your General Coin balance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is the refund policy during the beta?">
    Our standard policy is no refunds after using the models. However, since this is a beta, we want to ensure you're happy. If you encounter a technical issue or are unsatisfied, please contact **support@mefriend.ai**. We will review requests on a case-by-case basis. (Note: Refunds are generally not possible if significant usage of high-cost models has occurred).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do the monthly coins work?">
    Your plan's coins top up each month and are used for premium models (like Sage) or special features (like image generation). Unused subscription coins expire and new coins will be added.
  </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="What’s Auto-Memory?">
    It’s our system that allows your AI to store and recall key details from your chats forever. It's not limited by the context window, so your AI never loses track of your story. Our embedding-based VDB captures and recalls your most important details automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I don’t chat enough to justify the cost?">
    No worries—for light chatters, using coins for a few conversations will cost you less than the $14.99 subscription. However, with Prime, you also get the massive benefit of a 16K context window and Auto-Memory, which significantly enhance every single chat.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I cancel anytime?">
    Yes. You can cancel with one click from your settings page, and you won’t be charged for the next billing cycle.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do unused coins roll over?">
    Monthly subscription coins expire at the end of each 30-day cycle. The Prime plan provides a generous amount designed to give you a substantial buffer for deep dives into premium models.
