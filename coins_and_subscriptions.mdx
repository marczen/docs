## Why Both Coins and Subscriptions?

<Callout title="The Complete Picture" emoji="💡">
Mefriend offers **both coins and subscriptions** to give you maximum flexibility. Subscriptions provide **unlimited access** to certain AI models, while coins unlock **premium features** and **advanced models** beyond your plan's tier.
</Callout>

Think of it this way:
- **Subscriptions** = Unlimited chats with specific AI models (based on your tier)
- **Coins** = Currency for premium features and advanced models

## How Subscriptions Work

When you subscribe to any plan (Core, Prime, or Infinity), you get:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Unlimited Model Access" icon="infinity">
    Chat endlessly with models included in your tier—no coin deductions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monthly Coin Bonus" icon="coins">
    Receive coins every month to use on advanced features and models.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enhanced Features" icon="sparkles">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Larger Context Window" icon="window-maximize">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Unlimited Models by Tier

| Plan      | Unlimited Models                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Free**  | Lite                                      |
| **Core**  | Lite, Spark                               |
| **Prime** | Lite, Spark, Titan                        |
| **Infinity** | Lite, Spark, Titan, Sage, Nova         |

<Note>
When you chat with models included in your subscription tier, **no coins are deducted**. Chat as much as you want!
</Note>

## How Coins Work

Coins are the currency you use to access features and models **beyond your subscription tier**.

## Putting It All Together

Here's a real-world example of how subscriptions and coins work together:

<Card title="Example: Prime Subscriber" icon="user">
**Sarah subscribes to Prime ($14.99/month)**

✅ **Unlimited Chats:** She can chat endlessly with Lite, Spark, and Titan models with **zero coin cost**.

💰 **1,000 Monthly Coins:** She receives 1,000 coins each month to use however she wants.

🚀 **How she uses coins:**
- Occasionally tries Sage model for complex questions (costs coins)
- Generates images for her AI character stories (costs coins)
- Still has leftover coins for experimentation

📊 **The Value:** Without a subscription, chatting with Titan 1,000 times would cost $60 in coins. She gets this unlimited, plus $15 worth of bonus coins—all for just $14.99!
</Card>

## Coin Management

### Two Types of Coins

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="General Coins" icon="piggy-bank">
    Coins you purchase or earn through daily bonuses and referrals. **Never expire** and remain in your wallet permanently.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Subscription Coins" icon="calendar">
    Coins included with your monthly subscription. **Expire at the end of each billing cycle** (30 days).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Smart Coin Usage

<Info>
Our system is designed to maximize your value! When you use coins, the system **automatically uses Subscription Coins first** (which expire) before touching your General Coins (which don't expire). This ensures you never waste any coins.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="If I have unlimited chats, why do I need coins?">
    Unlimited chats apply only to the models **included in your tier**. Coins let you access more advanced models and special features beyond your plan. For example, a Prime member has unlimited Titan chats but can use coins to try Sage or Nova.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I run out of coins?">
    You can still chat unlimited with all the models included in your subscription tier! You'll only need more coins if you want to use advanced models or premium features beyond your plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use my subscription without using any coins?">
    Absolutely! If you're satisfied with the models included in your tier, you never need to use coins. Many subscribers stick to their unlimited models and save coins for special occasions.
