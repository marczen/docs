Ever been deep in a roleplay with TWO amazing ideas... and had to choose just one?

**Not anymore.** 🌟

Chat Branching gives you the superpower to explore every timeline, jump between possibilities instantly, and never lose a path again.

## 1) 🗺️ Chat Branching: Your Story Multiverse

<Check>
  Create infinite timelines from any moment. Every path is saved. Every
  possibility is one tap away.
</Check>

Say goodbye to duplicating chatrooms, copy-pasting context, and managing multiple separate conversations. Now you can explore every direction from any moment—all in one room.

<div align="center">
  <img
    src="/images/changelog/2025_10_31/branch_image.webp"
    alt="Chat Branching Interface"
    style={{
      borderRadius: "12px",
      boxShadow: "0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)",
      border: "1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)",
      margin: "2rem 0",
    }}
  />
</div>

### How It Works

You're deep in a roleplay. You have two ideas for where to take the story. Both are good. Why choose?

1. **Press the Branch button** on any message in your chat
2. **Continue the story** in the new branch—it's a fresh timeline from that point
3. **Press Branch again** from the same spot to explore another direction
4. **Open the Branch Map** to see all your timelines as a visual tree
5. **Jump instantly** to any branch or checkpoint with one tap

### What's Different

**Before:**

- Duplicate entire chatrooms manually
- Copy-paste context and summaries
- Manage multiple separate chats
- Lose track of which timeline is which
- Switch between rooms constantly

**Now:**

- ✨ One button creates a new branch
- 🚀 All timelines in ONE room
- 🗺️ Visual Branch Map shows every path
- ⚡ Jump between any timeline instantly
- 📍 Never lose progress or context

### Real-World Example

**Pivotal Scene**: Your character stands at a crossroads. Do they confront the villain, flee to safety, or try to negotiate?

**Branch 1**: Confrontation → explore the action path  
**Branch 2**: Flee → see the survival storyline  
**Branch 3**: Negotiate → discover the diplomatic route

All three timelines exist. All are instantly accessible. All progress is saved. The Branch Map shows them all at once.

<Info>
  The Branch Map makes it easy to compare how different choices affect your
  story without losing any of your creative work.

## 3) 🎯 Why This Changes Everything

### The Problem We Solved

Before branching, roleplayers faced these painful limitations:

- **Forced Choice**: Pick one path, lose the rest forever
- **Manual Duplication**: Copy entire chatrooms to try alternate paths
- **Context Loss**: Summarize and re-explain plot when switching rooms
- **Room Clutter**: Manage dozens of duplicate chats for one story
- **Navigation Hell**: Can't remember which room has which version

### The Solution

  <Card title="One Room, Infinite Paths" icon="house">
