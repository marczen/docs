## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does it import conversations too?">
    No. The import tool only brings over your character‚Äôs settings,
    descriptions, and personality data. Your past chats remain on the original
    platform.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I import characters I didn‚Äôt create?">
    No. To respect creators‚Äô rights, the import button only works for characters
    you own.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to keep the extension installed?">
    You only need it during the import process. Once your characters are on
    mefriend.ai, you can remove the extension if you want.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does it change anything on the original platform?">
    No. The import process is read-only‚Äîit never edits or deletes anything from
    the source.
